Hi, I am Joy. I'm a marketer who addicted to digital world. I built this blog to record my thoughts, study notes and share awesome ideas. Also, it will be my diary to see my growth. As my motto saying, I wants to be the change and keep learning my lifetime to hack my life.

I previously worked at [Embraco](https://www.embraco.com) as marketing management trainee, then joined a start-up team at [China.com](https://www.china.com), responsible for hi-tech wearable device's product marketing analysis and branding. Then, I got a chance to come to New Zealand working as a marketing coordinator in a private education provider, responsible for marketing research, analysis and social media.

My major was not in Marketing when I was in university. But my passion and working experience proved my capability in marketing field. I keep learning marketing online via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and obtained related certificates. You can check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyhumin/) profile to see what I have learned and what I know about marketing.
