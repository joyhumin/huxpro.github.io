Hi, I am Joy. I'm a marketer who is addicted to the digital world. I built this blog to record my thoughts, study notes and share awesome ideas. The blog will help me grow and lead me to the next progression in my life.
My  motto in life is to constantly evolve Keep learning and hack all the challenges I face in life.

I previously worked at [Embraco](https://www.embraco.com) as marketing management trainee, then joined a start-up team at [China.com](https://www.china.com), responsible for hi-tech wearable device's product marketing analysis and branding. Then, I got a chance to come to New Zealand working as a marketing coordinator for a private education provider, responsible for marketing research, analysis and social media.

My major was not in Marketing when I was at university. But my passion and working experience proved my capability in the marketing field. I am constantly up skilling in  marketing online via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and obtained related certificates. You can check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyhumin/) profile to see what I have learned and what I know about marketing.
