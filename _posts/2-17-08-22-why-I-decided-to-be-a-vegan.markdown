I made up my mind to be a vegan about one month ago. All my friends and family members who know I made this change are curious and don't understand my motivation.

In retrospect, I had jump on bandwagon and tried many different types of diet, like keto diet, Aktin diet, Paleo diet, copenhagen diet, you name it. And as a meat lover, I never understand why people could give up meat, eggs and dairy products and I could not image one day I would turn to be a vegan either.
