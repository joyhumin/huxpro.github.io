I made up my mind to be a vegan about one month ago. All my friends and family members who know I made this change were curious and could not understand my motivation behind this change.

In retrospect, I had jump on bandwagon many times and tried many different types of diet, like keto diet, Aktin diet, Paleo diet, copenhagen diet, you name it. And as a meat lover, I never understand why people could give up meat, eggs and dairy products and I could not image one day I would turn to be a vegan either.

Life is full of changes, isn't it. The biggest meat lover among my friends is turning into a vegan now. I thought it is gonna be very hard at the beginning when I adopted this diet. However, it turns out I love it so much that I would say it is the best diet I have tried ever.
