**My skin type:** Combination skin with Oily skin at T-Zone

**Reviews:**
I got this masque sample when I bought another Kiehl’s Mask (Rare Earth: Deep Pore Cleansing Masque, AKA, 科颜氏亚马逊白泥净致面膜). I knew the Rare Earth one is popular in China and many friends also recommended it to me. So, here are some feedbacks after I tried this sample comparing to the Rare Earth:

1. The scent is much better than Rare Earth.
2. The cranberry seeds create a rough texture that could benefit to skin exfoliation.
3. The burnt feeling is less intense than Rare Earth while you apply it on your face.
4. I could using the cranberry seed as facial exfoliator when you rising, but it was hard to cleaned up.
5. I had more cool feeling after rinsing.

In general, I prefer this mask than Rare Earth unexpectedly. Using once cannot tell if this masque could rejuvenate and brighten your skin. But it worth investing if you are looking for something could deep cleansing and soften your skin. Thanks to the BA share the sample with
me, I will purchase this product for sure after the Rare Earth being used up.

I never know that turmeric can be used as a skin care product. I learned a lot about turmeric’s benefits to our body, and I will definitely DIY some mask using turmeric in short future 😝
