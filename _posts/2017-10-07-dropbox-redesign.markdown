As a marketer, this is a good opportunity to learn about how the Big Name implementing brand revamping campaign. So, I did a little research and followings are my thoughts regarding this campaign. 

### What are the changes?

2. Dynamic color combination

Compared to the old logo combination which is blue and white, the new color combination is colorful and can be combined in a creative way.

3. New feature: Dropbox paper
A real-time collaborate document for team. 
> Our new brand system shows that Dropbox isnâ€™t just a place to store your files - itâ€™s a living workspace that brings teams and ideas together.  
Above is the statement showing in the [design website](https://dropbox.design) . My guess is that Dropbox is shifting their core business for Enterprise or team rather than individual.

2. Social medias
Consistent content across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. 
Using #creativeenergy 
#createtogether hashtags as the main content hashtags to mark the campaign content.

The new redesign campaign emphasize the creativity and collaboration within teams. I love the idea behind of this redesign that *they want to build a product and brand that help people focus on meaningful work.*
